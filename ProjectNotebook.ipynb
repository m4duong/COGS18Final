    "My project was my interpretation of a simple hangman game. I was inspired by a video by Webucator on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aAkDVXxNhk). The project uses 3 functions: `get_word()`, `replace_underscore()`, and `play_hangman()`. The code for `replace_underscore()` was taken from user gontajones from https://python-forum.io/Thread-Python-Hangman-Replacing-with-letters. The function `play_hangman()` is the main function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project/game runs as follows:\n",
    "1. `play_hangman()` is run.\n",
    "2. `get_word()` asks the user to choose one of two provided categories (TAs/IAs and Disney characters) and the function randomly selects a word from a premade list. Each letter in the word is replaced with an underscore, turned into a list, and the list is assigned to variable `guess_word`.\n",
    "3. In the while loop, the variable `current_word` is constantly updated with the correctly guessed letter. The while loop checks to see if the variable `current_word` is equal to word. If `current_word` is equal to `word`, then the loop breaks. If it is not equal to `word`, then the loop checks if there are still underscores and more than 0 guesses. If yes, it subtracts 1 from `guesses`, asks for an input, and checks if the input is in `word`. If so, `replace_underscore` prints out the new list. If not, then it will start at the top of the while loop. If there are 0 guesses, then the code will break.\n",
    "4. Once the code breaks, the word is printed out for the user."
